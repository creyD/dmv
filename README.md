## Future

This project will be stopped as there are better ways already to achieve a pretty similar result. Not as editors, but for exporting pictures or .dot files, they are great solutions. [Here](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_models.html) is a quick guide to how this would work with `django-extensions` which I have used for the past months now. The editor would've been a nice to have, but for a niche group of people and only for a small portion of the development time.

The code will stay online for reusing according to license.
